Git-based media storage is the default media storage option in Forestry. With this option, media is committed to your git repo, just like the rest of your content.

## Media Files Present in Git History

One advantage of using this storage option is that media files are stored in your repo. If something is accidentally deleted, it can easily be recovered from the project's commit history.

## Git LFS

If you upload a lot of media to your site, storing it all in your repo can cause a degradation in performance. To help with this, consider [using Git LFS to track media files](https://forestry.io/blog/versioning-large-files-with-git-lfs/). Forestry fully supports Git LFS when storing media in your GitHub repositories.

{{% warning "Known limitations" %}}

Images stored in GitLab and Bitbucket private repositories will not be shown in Forestry due to current limitations: [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45149](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/45149 "Deploy Tokens API")

Although GitHub supports LFS, GitHub pages does not. Tracking images with LFS will cause GitHub pages to generate empty files.
