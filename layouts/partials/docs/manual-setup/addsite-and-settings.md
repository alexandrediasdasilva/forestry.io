After you click **Next**, you will be prompted to enter the repository URL, the branch you wish to import, and (if you are importing a Jekyll or Hugo site,) the [config path](/docs/quickstart/setup-site#config-path). The repository URL should be the **SSH URL**, not the HTTPS URL.

## Completing the Connection

After you enter your repo information and click **Next**, you will be taken to the **repository settings** screen on your site dashboard. This screen will give you access to the information that needs to be added to your git provider's settings.
