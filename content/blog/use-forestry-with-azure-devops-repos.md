**Azure DevOps** is a suite of code collaboration and deployment tools provided by Microsoft. Azure DevOps includes cloud hosting for git repositories, similar to Github, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

As of today, you can now import **Azure DevOps** repositories into Forestry! Forestry will sync the contents of your Azure DevOps repository by importing changes when they're pushed to the repo, and committing content updates that you make in Forestry.

## Importing Azure DevOps Repos to Forestry

Our OAuth-based Quick Setup is not currently available for Azure DevOps repositories, so you must use our manual setup option when connecting to Azure DevOps.

Take a look at our [Azure DevOps](/docs/git-sync/azure-devops) repository docs for more information.
