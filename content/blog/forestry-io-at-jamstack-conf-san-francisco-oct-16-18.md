I'm excited to be speaking at [Jamstack Conf](https://jamstackconf.com/sf) in San Francisco on Oct 16th.   I'll be speaking about the future of content management and announcing an open-source project that we're really excited about.

The inaugural event was a blast last year and it sounds like they're taking it to the next level this year.

If you're attending this year, make sure you pop by our booth and say hi!  I hope to see you there!
